Step 1:Log in to your vSphere client. Each managed VMware cloud hosting here at Liquid Web comes with vSphere. Enter the IP address of the host on which has your vSphere installation. The login page will load. Enter your credentials and click login.

Step 2:Once logged in, navigate to your virtual machines. Choose a VM you wish to clone and right-click on it with your mouse. A menu will appear, and you can hover your mouse pointer over the Clone option. Finally, click on Clone to Virtual Machine

Step 3:Once you go through the process in step 2, a new window will appear. You need to name your VM clone and choose a location for it. Type in the name and select the location of your preference. Once done, click on the Next button in the lower right corner. 

Step 4:Select the destination compute resource for our VMware cloning VM operation and the host for the clone. Once completed, click the Next button again.

Step 5:Now we are going to select the storage for our VMware clone machine. Choose the disk on which you want to keep configuration files for this VM and click Next when you are ready.

Step 6:You will have a couple of options from which to choose. However, it is worth noting that if you want the exact copy of the original VM, you only need to select Power on virtual machines after creation. It will boot up your freshly cloned VM.

Click Next when ready.

Step 7:Here you see an overview of the previously selected options. Go through them once more, and if everything is correct, click the Finish button. If you want to change something, you can click the Back button to get back to one of the previous steps and make the necessary changes.
